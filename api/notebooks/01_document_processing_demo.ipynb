    "REAL ESTATE FAQ - Your Complete Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "BUYING A HOME\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What's the first step in buying a home?\n",
    "A: Get pre-approved for a mortgage! This involves submitting financial documents to a lender who will determine how much you can borrow. Pre-approval gives you a clear budget and shows sellers you're a serious buyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How much should I save for a down payment?\n",
    "A: Most conventional loans require 10-20% down, but FHA loans allow as little as 3.5%. Don't forget closing costs (2-5% of purchase price), moving expenses, and an emergency fund for unexpected repairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is a home inspection and do I need one?\n",
    "A: A home inspection is a thorough examination of the property by a licensed inspector. They check structural elements, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roof, and more. While not always required, it's highly recommended to avoid costly surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How long does it take to buy a house?\n",
    "A: From contract to closing typically takes 30-45 days for financed purchases. Cash buyers can close in 1-2 weeks. Factors affecting timeline include loan processing, inspections, appraisals, and title searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELLING A HOME\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: When is the best time to sell my home?\n",
    "A: Spring and early summer typically see the most buyer activity. However, the \"best\" time depends on your local market conditions, personal circumstances, and current inventory levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I determine my home's value?\n",
    "A: Get a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) from a real estate agent, or hire a professional appraiser. Online estimates are starting points but may not reflect recent sales or unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What repairs should I make before selling?\n",
    "A: Focus on high-impact, low-cost improvements: fresh paint, deep cleaning, minor repairs, and enhanced curb appeal. Major renovations rarely provide full return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKING WITH AGENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do I need a real estate agent?\n",
    "A: While not legally required, agents provide market expertise, negotiation skills, and handle complex paperwork. They can save you time and potentially money, especially for first-time buyers or sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I choose the right agent?\n",
    "A: Look for local market experience, recent sales activity, good communication skills, and client references. Interview 2-3 agents and ask about their marketing strategy and commission structure.\n",
